        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Bluejacking:** Sending unsolicited messages (like digital graffiti or contact cards) to a nearby Bluetooth device. It is annoying but harmless.\n*   **Bluesnarfing:** Unauthorized access to steal information (contacts, messages, photos) from a device via Bluetooth.\n\n**Data Theft:** **Bluesnarfing** is the critical threat."
        },
        "explanation": "Jacking is pranking; Snarfing is stealing."

        "ques": "**BLE** is used in IoT devices and smart trackers. Why is it often less secure than Classic Bluetooth?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**BLE** prioritizes low power consumption and fast pairing over security.\n\n**Weakness:** Many BLE devices do not implement encryption or authentication at the application layer, transmitting data in cleartext to save battery life. Anyone with a sniffer app (like nRF Connect) can read the data."

        "explanation": "Battery life vs. Security is the eternal IoT trade-off."

        "ques": "Understanding pairing is key. What is the **'Just Works'** pairing model in Bluetooth, and why is it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**'Just Works':** Designed for devices with no display (like headsets). It uses a hardcoded PIN (usually 0000) or no PIN at all.\n\n**Vulnerability:** Since there is no user verification matches, an attacker can impersonate both devices and intercept the keys exchanged during pairing."

        "explanation": "If you don't check a screen, you don't know who you are connecting to."
