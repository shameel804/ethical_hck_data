        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "This is likely an **Evil Twin** attack.\n\n**Mechanism:** An attacker sets up a rogue Access Point with the *exact same SSID* (name) as the legitimate network. They boost their signal strength to overpower the real AP, hoping your phone connects to them automatically. If you connect, they can intercept all your traffic."
        },

        "ques": "Why is a **Deauthentication (Deauth)** attack considered a Denial of Service? How does it help in capturing a WPA Handshake?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "A **Deauth** attack sends spoofed management frames telling a client 'Disconnect immediately!'.\n\n**DoS:** The client is disconnected from the internet.\n**Handshake Capture:** The client will immediately try to *reconnect*. During this reconnection, the client and AP exchange the **4-Way Handshake**. The attacker captures this handshake to crack the password offline."
        },
        "explanation": "It's like hanging up someone's phone so you can record them dialing it back."

        "ques": "The **KRACK** attack (2017) was a devastating vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol itself. What did it allow attackers to do?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It tricked the client into reinstalling an already-in-use encryption key (hence Key Reinstallation).\n\n**Impact:** By resetting the key parameters (Nonce and Replay Counter), the attacker could decrypt the data stream without ever knowing the actual WiFi password."
        },
        "explanation": "It proved that even WPA2-AES wasn't invincible."

            "content": "**Karma / PineAP:** \nDevices constantly shout out 'Is *Home WiFi* here? Is *Office WiFi* here?'.\n\nThe Pineapple creates a fake AP for *every* request. It replies 'Yes, I am Home WiFi' and 'Yes, I am Office WiFi', tricking the device into connecting to it automatically."
