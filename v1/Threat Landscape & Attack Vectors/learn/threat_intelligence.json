Disruption/Defacement.\n3.  **Cybercriminals:** Money motivated (Ransomware, Theft). The majority of attacks.\n4.  **Insiders:** Disgruntled employees. Access is their weapon.\n5.  **Nation-State (APTs):** Government-funded. Espionage, Critical Infra sabotage. Highly skilled.\n6.  **Terrorist Groups:** Ideological violence via cyber means."

They stay for months/years.\n- **Threat:** Specific objectives (Intel, sabotage).\n\n## Famous Groups\n- **APT28 (Fancy Bear):** Russia. Targeted US DNC.\n- **APT1 (Unit 61398):** China. Intellectual property theft.\n- **Lazarus Group:** North Korea. Sony Hack, WannaCry (Money for regime).\n- **Equation Group:** USA (NSA linked). Stuxnet."
