Uses gathered intel.\n- **Whaling:** Targeting high-profile executives (CEO, CFO).\n- **Smishing:** SMS Phishing.\n- **Vishing:** Voice Phishing (Phone calls).\n\n> 🚩 **Red Flags:** Urgency (\"Act now!\"), mismatched URLs, grammar errors, requesting payments/passwords."

Can you spot them?\n\n- **Typosquatting:** `goggle.com` vs `google.com`.\n- **Homoglyphs:** `appIe.com` (Capital 'i') vs `apple.com` (Lowercase 'L').\n- **Subdomain Abuse:** `google.com.security-check.xyz` (This is NOT Google! It is `xyz`).\n- **URL Shorteners:** `bit.ly/3xyz` hides the destination.\n- **Open Redirects:** `google.com/url?q=http://evil.com` (Looks like Google, redirects to Evil).\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef analyze_url(url):\n    domain = urlparse(url).netloc\n    print(f\"Navigating to: {domain}\")\n    # If domain ends with '.xyz' or is IP address -> Suspicious\n\nanalyze_url(\"https://google.com.security-check.xyz/login\")\n# Output: Navigating to: google.com.security-check.xyz\n```"

Malicious code was pushed out in a legitimate update signed by SolarWinds. 18,000 companies installed the backdoor.\n- **Kaseya:** MSP software compromised to deploy ransomware to customers.\n- **NPM/PyPI:** Attackers publish malicious packages with names similar to popular ones (`request` vs `requests`)."

A zero-day for iPhone (remote jailbreak) can sell for **$2 Million+** to firms like Zerodium.\n\n## Defense\nSince there is no patch/signature:\n- **Behavioral Analysis:** Does this Word doc trying to launch PowerShell look normal? No.\n- **Sandboxing:** Detonate unknown files in isolation.\n- **Microsegmentation:** Limit the blast radius."
