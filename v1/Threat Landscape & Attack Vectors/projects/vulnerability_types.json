            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Scenario:**\nAn attacker adds an item designed to cost $1000 to their cart. They intercept the request and change the quantity to **-1**. The system calculates the total: -$1000. They then add another different item worth $1050. The checkout total becomes $50. The system processes the payment, and the attacker gets $1050 worth of goods for $50 because the logic didn't validate that quantities must be positive."

            "content": "A **Race Condition** occurs when the security of a system depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events.\n\n**TOCTOU Example:**\n1.  **Check:** System checks if User A has permission to write to `file.txt`. (Result: Yes).\n2.  *Attacker quickly swaps `file.txt` with `password_db` link.*\n3.  **Use:** System writes to the file. Since it already checked permission, it writes to `password_db`, overwriting it.\nThe gap between step 1 and 3 is the race window."
