        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  **Script Kiddies:** **Notoriety/Chaos**. They use existing tools to hack for fun or bragging rights with little skill.\n2.  **Hacktivists:** **Ideology/Political**. They hack to promote a political or social cause (e.g., Anonymous).\n3.  **Nation-State Actors:** **Espionage/Geopolitical Strategic Advantage**. Highly skilled groups funded by governments to steal secrets or disrupt infrastructure (e.g., APT28)."
        },
        "explanation": "Understanding the *who* and *why* helps in predicting *how* they might attack."

        "ques": "What defines an **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** group? Why are they considered more dangerous than typical cybercriminals? Name one well-known APT group.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**APT groups** are stealthy, sophisticated threat actors (usually nation-state sponsored) that gain unauthorized access to a network and remain undetected for an extended period.\n\n**Why dangerous:**\n*   **Resources:** Unlimited funding and custom zero-day exploits.\n*   **Persistence:** They don't just 'smash and grab'; they install backdoors to spy for years.\n\n**Example:** **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**, linked to Russian intelligence."
        },
        "explanation": "The 'Persistent' part is key. You might kick them out of one server, but they are likely hiding in three others."

            "content": "*   **Tactics:** The 'Why'. The tactical goal of the adversary. (e.g., 'Initial Access', 'Privilege Escalation', 'Lateral Movement').\n*   **Techniques:** The 'How'. The specific method used to achieve the tactical goal. (e.g., 'Phishing via Spearphishing Link' is a technique to achieve 'Initial Access')."
        },
        "explanation": "David Bianco's 'Pyramid of Pain' places TTPs at the top. They are the hardest thing for an attacker to change, so detecting them is the most valuable."

        },
        "explanation": "IoCs are the 'fingerprints' left behind at a crime scene. Blocking them provides a basic level of defense, though they are easy for attackers to change."

Focuses on longer-term risks, financial impact, and geopolitical events. (e.g., 'Ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector are rising by 40%').\n*   **Operational Intelligence:** Actionable technical details for security teams (SOC). Focuses on specific attacks and TTPs. (e.g., 'Block IP 192.168.1.5 immediately; it's a C2 server for Emotet')."
