        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The attacker creates a scheduled task (Windows) or Cron job (Linux) that runs their malware at a specific interval (e.g., every day at midnight) or on an event (e.g., at system startup).\n\nEven if the malware process is killed, the OS automatically revives it when the scheduled time occurs."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**DNS Tunneling** encodes stolen data inside DNS queries (e.g., `secret-password.attacker.com`).\n\n**Why it works:** Most firewalls allow DNS traffic (UDP 53) outbound because the internet breaks without it. Attackers ride this trusted protocol to smuggle data out, bypassing standard firewall rules that block HTTP/FTP."

            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Timestomping** is the act of modifying the timestamps (Created, Modified, Accessed) of a file (usually malware) to match other legitimate files in the same folder.\n\n**Goal:** To blend in. If all system files are dated 2021 and the malware is dated today, it sticks out. Changing it to 2021 makes it invisible to a quick glance."
