        "ques": "**SQL Injection** allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. Explain what the input `' OR '1'='1` does in a login field.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "It alters the logic of the query.\n\n**Original:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'password'`\n**Injected:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' ...`\n\nSince `'1'='1'` is always **TRUE**, the database returns the user record (often the first one, which is Administrator) regardless of the password."
        },
        "explanation": "This tells the database: 'Give me the user if the name matches OR if True is True'. Since True is always True, it logs you in."

        "title": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "ques": "There are three main types of **XSS**. Briefly define **Stored XSS** and **Reflected XSS**.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  **Reflected XSS:** The malicious script is bounced off the web server immediately (e.g., in a search result or error message). The victim must click a link containing the payload.\n2.  **Stored XSS (Persistent):** The malicious script is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a forum post or comment). Every user who views that page executes the script automatically."
        },
        "explanation": "Stored XSS is more dangerous because it doesn't require phishing specific victims."

        "title": "Command Injection",
        "ques": "**Command Injection** allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the server. If an app takes an IP address to 'ping' it, how could you exploit this?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Input:** `; cat /etc/passwd`\n\nThe server runs: `ping [input]`\nWith injection: `ping 127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd`\n\nThe semicolon `;` terminates the ping command and starts a new one (`cat`), dumping the password file to the screen."
        },
        "explanation": "Always validate input. Never pass user input directly to a system shell."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The goal is to step out of the web root directory to access files that should not be publicly accessible.\n\n**Example:** `http://site.com/view?file=../../../../etc/passwd`\nThis typically tries to go up 4 directories to the root and read the system password file."
        },
        "explanation": "Ideally, a web server should be jailed to its own directory."

        "title": "XML External Entity (XXE)",
        "ques": "**XXE** attacks exploit weakly configured XML parsers. How can an attacker use an External Entity definition to read local files?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The attacker defines a custom entity in the XML DOCTYPE that points to a file path:\n`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >`\n\nWhen the parser processes the XML and sees the reference `&xxe;`, it faithfully opens the file on the server and pastes its content into the document."
        },
        "explanation": "XML parsers are powerful; sometimes too powerful for their own good."
