        "ques": "Explain the concept of a **Drive-by Download**. Does the user need to click 'Download' to get infected?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Concept:** Unintended download of malicious software from the internet.\n\n**Interaction:** No, the user typically **does not** need to click anything. \n\n**Mechanism:** Simply visiting a compromised website (or viewing a malicious ad) triggers an exploit in the browser or a plugin (like Flash/Java in the past), which executes shellcode to download and run the malware silently in the background."
        },
        "explanation": "This exploits the passive nature of web browsing. The browser is an execution environment; if it has a bug, 'viewing' equals 'executing'."

        "title": "JIT (Just-In-Time) Exploitation",
        "ques": "Modern JavaScript engines (V8, SpiderMonkey) use **JIT compilation** to speed up code. Why is the JIT compiler a frequent target for exploitation?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Reason:** JIT compilers are complex machines that translate high-level JS into native machine code at runtime.\n\n**Vulnerability:** Bugs in the optimization phase can lead to incorrect machine code generation (e.g., removing a bounds check that the optimizer thought was redundant). Attackers craft specific JS patterns to trigger these optimization bugs, allowing them to read/write memory out of bounds (OOB) and gain code execution."
        },
        "explanation": "Complexity is the enemy of security. The quest for speed introduces subtle logic errors in memory management."

        "title": "Use-After-Free (UAF) in Browsers",
        "ques": "What is a **Use-After-Free** vulnerability? If an attacker can control the memory of a 'freed' DOM object, what can they achieve?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Def:** Attempting to access memory after it has been freed.\n\n**Exploit:**\n1.  **Free:** The attacker triggers the deletion of an object (e.g., a DOM element).\n2.  **Replace:** They act quickly to fill that freed memory slot with their own malicious data (Heap Spraying).\n3.  **Use:** The browser engine tries to use the old (now deleted) object. Instead of the original data, it executes the attacker's data/pointers.\n\n**Result:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the renderer process."
        },
        "explanation": "Browser rendering engines (C++) manually manage memory. UAF is the most common class of memory corruption bug."
    },
    {
        "title": "Sandbox Escapes",
        "ques": "Getting RCE in the browser usually only gives you control over the **Renderer Process**, which is sandboxed. What is a **Sandbox Escape**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Definition:** A secondary exploit that breaks out of the restricted environment (Sandbox).\n\n**Goal:** The renderer process has low privileges (cannot read files, install apps). A sandbox escape targets the **Browser Kernel** (attributes, IPC mechanism) or the OS kernel itself to elevate privileges to 'System' or 'User' level, achieving full compromise of the machine."
        },
        "explanation": "Modern browser exploitation is a chain: 1. Renderer Exploit (RCE) -> 2. Sandbox Escape (eop)."

        "title": "Browser Exploit Kits",
        "ques": "What is an **Exploit Kit** (EK)? Name one stage in the typical infection chain used by EKs.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Definition:** Automated software toolkits hosted on malicious servers that profile visitors and automatically deliver the correct exploit for their specific browser/plugin version.\n\n**Stage (Redirect):** The user is redirected from a legitimate compromised site to the EK landing page via an invisible iframe or malvertising. The EK then runs a script to detect plugins (Flash, Java, Silverlight) and fires the appropriate exploit."
        },
        "explanation": "EKs lowered the barrier to entry for cybercriminals, automating the technical side of exploitation."
