        "ques": "**Fuzzing** is an automated software testing technique. What does a fuzzer do, and what implies a vulnerability was found?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Action:** A fuzzer sends massive amounts of invalid, unexpected, or random data (fuzz) to the inputs of a computer program.\n\n**Success:** If the program **Crashes**, hangs, or leaks memory, a vulnerability has likely been found. The crash dump can be analyzed to see if the crash is exploitable (e.g., overwriting the instruction pointer)."
        },
        "explanation": "If you feed garbage to a program, it should handle it gracefully. If it chokes, you found a bug."

        "ques": "In a secure **Code Review**, what is the advantage of a human reviewer over an automated Static Analysis (SAST) tool?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Context and Logic.**\n\nAutomated tools are great at finding syntax errors (like `strcpy` usage) but terrible at understanding **Business Logic**. A human can look at a payment function and realize, 'Wait, this code processes the refund *before* verifying the original transaction exists.' No tool would flag that as a syntax error."
        },
        "explanation": "Tools find bugs; Humans find flaws."

        "title": "Threat Hunting",
        "ques": "How does **Threat Hunting** differ from standard Incident Response (IR)?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Incident Response:** Reactive. An alert goes off (SIEM), and the team investigates.\n*   **Threat Hunting:** Proactive. No alert has gone off. The hunter assumes the network is *already* compromised and actively digs through data (logs, endpoints) looking for evidence of undetected threats."
        },
        "explanation": "IR is putting out fires. Threat Hunting is checking the walls for faulty wiring before a fire starts."

        "ques": "What is the primary goal of a **Red Team Engagement** compared to a standard Penetration Test?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Penetration Test:** Find as many vulnerabilities as possible in a short time. (Broad).\n*   **Red Team:** Test the organization's **detection and response** capabilities. The goal is to simulate a real adversary to achieve a specific objective (e.g., steal the CEO's emails) without being caught. (Deep/Stealthy)."
        },
        "explanation": "A Pen Test asks 'Can you break in?'. A Red Team asks 'Can we stop you?'."

        "ques": "When source code is not available, analysts perform **Binary Analysis**. What is the difference between **Disassembly** and **Decompilation**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Disassembly:** Converts machine code (0s and 1s) into Assembly language (e.g., `MOV EAX, 1`). It is a 1-to-1 exact representation.\n*   **Decompilation:** Attempts to recreate high-level source code (C++/Java) from the binary. It is an approximation and often loses variable names and comments, making it harder to read but higher level."
        },
        "explanation": "This is the realm of Reverse Engineering."
