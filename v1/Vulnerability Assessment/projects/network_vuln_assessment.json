        "ques": "You are assessing a network and find an FTP server running **vsftpd 2.3.4**. Why is this specific version a classic finding in vulnerability assessments?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**vsftpd 2.3.4** is infamous for having a **backdoor** introduced into its source code. If a user tries to log in with a username ending in a smiley face `:)`, the server opens a root shell on port 6200.\n\n**Lesson:** Identifying EOL (End of Life) or specific vulnerable versions is the easiest way into a network."
        },
        "explanation": "Always patch your services. This backdoor was present for days before being noticed."

        "title": "Protocol Weaknesses: Telnet & FTP",
        "ques": "Why is finding **Telnet** (Port 23) or **FTP** (Port 21) active on an internal network considered a 'High' severity finding?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Both Telnet and standard FTP transmit data, including usernames and passwords, in **Cleartext**.\n\n**Risk:** An attacker on the local network can use a sniffer (like Wireshark) to capture valid credentials from the wire effortlessly."
        },
        "explanation": "Use SSH (Port 22) and SFTP/SCP instead. Friends don't let friends use Telnet."

        "ques": "When auditing a network switch or router, what is meant by **'Disabling Unused Interfaces'** and why is it important?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Practice:** Administratively shutting down any Ethernet ports that are not currently in use.\n\n**Why:** It prevents a rogue employee or physical intruder from simply walking up to a wall jack, plugging in a laptop, and gaining instant access to the internal network."
        },
        "explanation": "If a port isn't needed, turn it off. Physical security is network security."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "A **Rogue AP** is an unauthorized wireless access point connected to the corporate network.\n\n**Example:** An employee gets bad WiFi reception in their office, so they bring a router from home and plug it into the wall jack under their desk. This creates an unmonitored, potentially unencrypted backdoor into the secure corporate network that bypasses the firewall."
        },
        "explanation": "Security teams sweep the building with antennas just to find these 'helpful' additions."

        "ques": "**SNMP** (Simple Network Management Protocol) is used to monitor devices. What is the danger of leaving the default community string **'public'** enabled?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**'public'** is the default SNMP Read-Only string. It acts like a password.\n\n**Danger:** If left enabled, an attacker can query the device for extensive details: ARP tables, routing tables, interface statuses, and system uptime. This provides a detailed map of the internal network for free."
        },
        "explanation": "Change default passwords. Always. 'public' checks are script-kiddie 101."
