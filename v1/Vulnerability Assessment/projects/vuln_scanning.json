            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Network-Based Scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS):** Scan the network for open ports and services, identifying vulnerabilities visible from the outside. Good for finding unpatched services.\n*   **Host-Based Scanners:** Installed on the specific machine (agent). They scan the local OS configuration, registry, and file permissions. Good for finding internal misconfigurations and missing patches not visible to the network."

        "title": "Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed Scans",
        "ques": "What is the difference between a **Credentialed** scan and a **Non-Credentialed** scan? Which one provides more accurate results and why?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Non-Credentialed:** The scanner acts like an outsider. It can only see what is exposed publicly (open ports, banner versions).\n*   **Credentialed:** The scanner logs into the target system with a username/password. It can check installed software versions (even if not listening on a port), registry keys, and config files.\n\n**Winner:** **Credentialed**. It finds far more vulnerabilities and reduces false positives."
        },
        "explanation": "Non-credentialed is like looking at a house from the street; Credentialed is walking inside and checking the wiring."

        "ques": "In the context of vulnerability scanning, define **False Positive** and **False Negative**. Which is more dangerous?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **False Positive:** The scanner claims there is a vulnerability, but there isn't (e.g., flagging a backported patch). *Annoying, wastes time.*\n*   **False Negative:** The scanner says the system is safe, but there IS a vulnerability. *Dangerous.*\n\n**Most Dangerous:** **False Negative**, because it gives a false sense of security, leaving you exposed."

        "explanation": "A silent alarm that fails to ring during a burglary is worse than one that rings by accident."

        "title": "CVSS Risk Scoring",
        "ques": "The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** provides a numerical score (0-10) for vulnerabilities. What are the three metric groups that make up the score?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "1.  **Base Score:** Intrinsic qualities of the vulnerability (Exploitability, Impact). Constant over time and environment.\n2.  **Temporal Score:** Changes over time (e.g., Is exploit code available? Has a patch been released?).\n3.  **Environmental Score:** Specific to your environment (e.g., Is this server critical? Is it behind a firewall?)."
        },
        "explanation": "Most people only look at the Base Score, but the Environmental Score tells the real story for *your* organization."

        "title": "Scan Scheduling",
        "ques": "Why should vulnerability scans be scheduled to run **continuously** or at least frequently, rather than just once a year?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Networks change daily. New servers are spun up, new software is installed, and **new vulnerabilities are discovered every day**.\nA clean scan from last month means nothing today if a new Zero-Day was released yesterday for your web server software."
        },
        "explanation": "Security is a snapshot in time. Continuous scanning turns that snapshot into a movie."
