        "ques": "**DAST** (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is performed by automated web scanners like Burp Suite Pro or OWASP ZAP. How does DAST differ from SAST (Static Analysis)?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**DAST (Black Box):** Tests the running application from the outside, like an attacker would. It sends requests and analyzes responses for errors (e.g., SQL syntax errors).\n**SAST (White Box):** Analyzes the source code at rest. It looks for insecure coding patterns (e.g., hardcoded passwords) without running the app."
        },
        "explanation": "You need both. SAST finds buggy code; DAST finds buggy behavior."

        "title": "Input Validation Testing: XSS",
        "ques": "When testing for **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, what is the tester trying to achieve by injecting a script like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a search box?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "The tester wants to see if the application takes the input and 'reflects' it back to the browser exactly as typed, without **sanitization** or **encoding**.\n\nIf the browser executes the script (pops up the alert box), the application is vulnerable. The goal is to prove that user input can be interpreted as code."
        },
        "explanation": "Context matters. Input safe for a database might be dangerous if reflected in HTML."

        "title": "Session Management Testing",
        "ques": "A critical part of web assessment is checking **Session Management**. What is the risk if the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags are missing from a session cookie?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "*   **Missing `Secure`:** The cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, allowing it to be sniffed by an attacker on the wire.\n*   **Missing `HttpOnly`:** The cookie can be accessed by JavaScript (e.g., `document.cookie`). This means if the site has an XSS vulnerability, the attacker can steal the session cookie and hijack the account."
        },
        "explanation": "These two flags are the bread and butter of cookie security."

        "title": "Manual Testing: Logic Flaws",
        "ques": "Why are automated scanners notoriously bad at finding **IDOR** (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities, requiring manual testing?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**IDOR** occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal object (like `order_id=100`) but fails to verify if the user is authorized to see it.\n\n**Scanner Limitation:** A scanner sees that it requested `ID=100` and got a '200 OK' response. It assumes success as it doesn't know that the user *shouldn't* be able to see Order #100. A human tester notices, 'Hey, that's not my order!'."

        "explanation": "Scanners understand syntax (SQLi); Humans understand context (IDOR)."

        "title": "Configuration Review: HTTP Headers",
        "ques": "During a configuration review, you check for security headers. What is the purpose of the **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** header?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**HSTS** forces the browser to *only* communicate with the website over HTTPS.\n\nOnce a browser sees this header, it will automatically upgrade all future requests to HTTPS and refuse to connect if the certificate is invalid. This prevents SSL Stripping attacks."
        },
        "explanation": "It tells the browser: 'Never, ever talk to me on port 80 again.'"
