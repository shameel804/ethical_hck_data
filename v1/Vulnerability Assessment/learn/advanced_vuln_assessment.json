Advanced techniques find the deep, complex bugs that attackers use for high-value hacks.\n\n## Techniques\n- **Fuzzing:** Throwing garbage at the app until it crashes.\n- **Code Review:** Reading the source to find bugs.\n- **Binary Analysis:** Reverse engineering compiled code.\n- **Red Teaming:** Simulating a full-scale attack (Social + Physical + Digital).\n- **Threat Hunting:** Looking for attackers already inside."

What if we send \"A\" * 1,000,000? Or \"\\x00\\xFF\"?\n\n## Types\n- **Mutation:** Take valid input and mutate it slightly (Flip bits).\n- **Generation:** Generate inputs from scratch based on a specific format (e.g., PDF specification).\n\n## Tools\n- **AFL (American Fuzzy Lop):** Famous fuzzer for binaries.\n- **Wfuzz:** Web application fuzzer (brute forcing parameters)."
