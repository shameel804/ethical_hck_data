        "ques": "Both viruses and worms self-replicate. What is the key difference in their **propagation method**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Virus:** Needs a **host file** (like infecting a `.exe`) and **user interaction** (running the infected program) to spread.\n\n**Worm:** **Self-contained** program. It actively scans the network for vulnerabilities and spreads automatically **without** any user intervention."
        },
        "explanation": "Viruses infect *files*. Worms infect *networks*. Worms spread much faster (e.g., WannaCry)."

        "title": "Trojan Horse",
        "ques": "A **Trojan** malware is named after the Greek myth. What is its defining characteristic?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Disguise:** A Trojan masquerades as legitimate, useful software (e.g., a cracked game, a PDF converter, or a system update). It tricks the user into installing it willingly. Unlike viruses/worms, Trojans typically do not self-replicate."
        },
        "explanation": "It relies on social engineering rather than technical exploits to gain initial access."

        "ques": "What is the primary objective of **Ransomware**? Describe the concept of 'Double Extortion'.",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Objective:** To deny access to data via **encryption** and demand payment for the decryption key.\n\n**Double Extortion:** Attackers don't just encrypt data; they first **exfiltrate** (steal) sensitive data. They threaten to leak it publicly if the ransom is not paid. This pressures victims who have backups (and could restore data) to pay anyway to prevent a data breach."
        },
        "explanation": "Ransomware has evolved from a nuisance to a full-scale business model targeting availability and confidentiality."

        "title": "Rootkits (Kernel Mode)",
        "ques": "Why is a **Kernel-Mode Rootkit** (Ring 0) so difficult for standard antivirus software to detect?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Control:** The rootkit operates at the same privilege level as the Operating System kernel. It can intercept system calls (hooking).\n\n**Stealth:** When the AV asks the OS 'List all files', the rootkit intercepts the answer and filters out its own files. The OS effectively lies to the AV because the OS itself is compromised."
        },
        "explanation": "You cannot trust the system to report on itself if the reporting mechanism is compromised."

        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Botnet:** A network of compromised computers ('zombies' or 'bots') controlled by a single attacker.\n\n**C&C Role:** It is the central server that issues commands to the bots (e.g., 'Target this IP with DDoS', 'Send spam email'). Taking down the C&C server is the primary method to neutralize a botnet."
        },
        "explanation": "Botnets leverage the power of many. Strength in numbers."
