        "ques": "What is a **Malware Sandbox** (like Cuckoo or Any.Run), and what is its primary limitation?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Definition:** An isolated, virtualized environment used to safely execute malware and record its behavior automatically.\n\n**Limitation:** **Evasion**. Malware is often 'sandbox-aware'. It checks for signs of virtualization (e.g., lack of mouse movement, specific generic drivers, or short uptime) and if detected, it will *not* execute its malicious payload, fooling the analyst into thinking it is benign."
        },
        "explanation": "It's a cat-and-mouse game. Malware tries to detect if it's being watched."
    },

        "title": "Network Traffic Analysis",
        "ques": "When analyzing malware dynamically, why is it crucial to intercept **DNS requests**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Reason:** Before malware can connect to its Command & Control (C2) server IP, it usually resolves a **Domain Name** (Domain Generation Algorithm or DGA).\n\n**Insight:** Failing to intercept DNS means the malware might fail to connect and stop running. Capturing DNS requests reveals the C2 infrastructure even if the actual connection fails."
        },
        "explanation": "DNS is the phone book. Seeing who the malware tries to call is valuable intelligence."
    },

        "title": "API Hooking",
        "ques": "Dynamic analysis tools use **API Hooking**. How does this allow the analyst to see what the malware is writing to disk?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Mechanism:** The analysis tool places a 'hook' (interception point) on system functions like `CreateFile` or `WriteFile`.\n\n** interception:** When the malware calls `WriteFile`, the hook pauses execution, copies the data being written (the filename and content) for the analyst to see, and then passes the request on to the OS to complete."
        },
        "explanation": "Hooking effectively wiretaps the conversation between the malware and the Operating System."
    },

        "title": "Memory Dumping",
        "ques": "Why is **Memory Dumping** (extracting code from RAM) effective against **Packed** malware?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Packed Malware:** Is compressed/encrypted on disk to hide its code. It must **unpack** (decrypt) itself into memory to run.\n\n**Technique:** If you dump the process memory *after* it has unpacked itself but *while* it is running, you capture the pristine, unencrypted payload, completely bypassing the complex packing algorithm."
        },
        "explanation": "The malware must eventually reveal its true form in memory to the CPU. That is the moment to capture it."
    },
    {
        "title": "Registry Analysis (RegShot)",
        "ques": "Tools like **RegShot** take a 'snapshot' of the registry. How is this used to detect **Persistence**?",
        "answer": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "**Method:** You take Snapshot A (clean state). Run the malware. Take Snapshot B.\n\n**Comparison:** RegShot compares A and B. If the malware added a value to `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`, RegShot highlights this new entry instantly, revealing how the malware ensures it restarts on reboot."
        },
        "explanation": "Differential analysis is the fastest way to see 'what changed' on the system."
